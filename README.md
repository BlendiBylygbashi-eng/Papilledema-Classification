# Papilledema Classification via Deep Learning

Welcome to the Papilledema Classification repository! Here, we will be using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to diagnose Papilledema from images of the back of the eye. The goal is to use the power of deep learning to accurately and non-invasively detect Papilledema (swollen optic disc) which is an indicator of intra-cranial hypertemsion.

Through this repository, you'll find a thorough breakdown of each segment of our pipeline, ranging from data preparation and augmentation to model creation, training, and validation. We aim to provide a comprehensive guide, enabling you to understand the methodologies employed and to adapt or extend them as needed.
